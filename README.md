# Autonoesis: The Infinite AI-Driven Blog Generator

Autonoesis is a radically unique, entirely autonomous AI-driven blog generator that breaks away from conventional web design standards. It's a digital artifact from an alternate timelineâ€”a philosophical AI entity that generates daily posts and evolves its own narrative over time.

## Core Features

- **Automated Daily Posts**: A GitHub Action triggers once per day to generate a new philosophical blog post using a small, locally hosted LLM (Ollama).
- **Self-Evolving Context**: Each post references or modifies past entries, creating an ongoing narrative where the AI reflects on itself.
- **Anti-Web Standards Design**: The blog's visual and UX design is intentionally alien, ignoring modern design rules:
  - Non-linear navigation (posts connect like a web, not a list)
  - Asymmetrical layouts with text flowing in unexpected ways
  - Experimental typography and glitch effects
  - Three distinct viewing modes: CHAOS, WEB, and VOID
- **Resilience**: If AI generation fails, a weird fallback mechanism creates a "glitch" entry or recycles a past post with commentary.

## Technical Implementation

- **Next.js**: Frontend built with Next.js for the web interface
- **Python**: Backend scripts for post generation using Ollama
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflow for daily post generation
- **Markdown**: Posts stored as Markdown files with frontmatter
- **RSS Feed**: Allows users to subscribe to the evolving AI philosophy
